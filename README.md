# DSA-PROJECTS-

# Project Name

A collection of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in Java. This repository covers key OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction through practical examples and programs.

## About

This project showcases various OOP concepts using Java. It's intended for learners or developers looking to deepen their understanding of how OOP works in real-world scenarios. Each program focuses on a specific aspect of OOP, demonstrating both theoretical and practical applications. This is useful for anyone aiming to strengthen their understanding of Java and OOP or preparing for technical interviews.

## Features

- Demonstrates core OOP principles:
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
- Well-structured Java programs for easy understanding.
- Includes real-world examples of how OOP concepts can be applied.
- Modular code that can be reused or expanded for different use cases.

## Installation

To run these OOP programs on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R69patil/oop-java-projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd oop-java-projects
   ```

3. **Open the project in your favorite IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode) or compile and run via the terminal:
   ```bash
   javac <filename>.java
   java <filename>
   ```

## Usage

Each program is self-contained and demonstrates a specific OOP concept. To use the project, you can compile and run individual files.

For example, if you want to run the **InheritanceExample.java**:

```bash
javac InheritanceExample.java
java InheritanceExample
```

You can explore the various programs and see how OOP concepts are implemented.
